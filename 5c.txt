c)	Create a prototype of a student object using initializer. The object should contain an array with list of courses each student should take. Write a function creating new objects based on this prototype, setting their first and last name and id properties.

Not sure what is being asked for here. 

Is the list of courses just some random thing we put in?

what does it mean to create new objects based on this prototype?
